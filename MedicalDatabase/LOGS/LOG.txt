1631 22Dec2023:
  Update and display page for patientinfo is working well

1637 22Dec2023:
  Transferring from vitalsigns.php to patientinfo.php page is working with specific patient

1707 22Dec2023:
  EditVitalSigns is working (does not save progress when switching to another checkin)

1710 22Dec2023:
  Starting edit of index.php (go to previous ver to retrieve hard-coded list)

1826 22Dec2023:
  Patient List Includes Occupations (Student/Faculty), and student grades (working)

1846 22Dec2023:
  Occupations, Student Grades, Student Sections dropdowns completed

1932 22Dec2023:
  Patient List in completed
  Error: what if walang check in ang bata? there is no $recentCheckIn for the patientinfo.php page

1659 24Dec2023:
  Update on patientinfo.php:
  if-else statement on href leading to vitalsigns.php (if there is no check-in, return null value on passed value to vitalsigns.php, else pass most recent check in)
  changed $patientInfo on vitalsigns (referencing vitalsigns table was irrelevant)

  1637 I'm literally going to fmita

  fixed the fucking problem with the dynamic dropdown (if hindi siya natouch on the update page null yung value niya and the grade would be the grade mismo not the id)

1655 27Dec2023
  Update on AddVitalSigns.php:
  - manual incrementing for IDs in vital signs and checkins tables (checkins.CheckIn_ID = VitalSigns.VitalSigns_ID)
  Update on vitalsigns.php:
  - updated $displayedCheckIn from "SELECT * FROM checkins..." to "SELECT * FROM vitalsigns..." kasi yung CheckInID pertained to the latter is directed towards checkin count of a person
    it only affects the $displayedVitals lang naman and so far there are no errors in testing...

1711 27Dec2023
  Program is working based on expected performance so far
  Comments:
  - EditVitalSigns.php needs editing based on changes with AddVitalSigns.php
  - Delete functions should be added

1745 27Dec2023
  Update on vitalsigns.php:
  - $patient var (only affects $CheckInID which determines checkin no. of a specific person) was NOT changed because the $CheckInID is based on the vitalsigns table's CheckIn_ID col (which is the check in of a specific person)
  - $displayedVitals edited because it returned wrong array

  Update on EditVitalSigns.php:
  - updated $CheckIns from that in vitalsigns.php

1746 27Dec2023 [NO EDITS, NO COPY]
  Plan for delete function:
    - in patientinfo.php, if a person is removed from the db, ensure that all corresponding to their Patient_ID is removed as well
    - in vitalsigns.php, on a specific check-in corresponding to that person, their info is deleted in vitalsigns table and checkins table
    - DO NOT add delete functions on edit pages because it might send the wrong intuitions (confused with cancelling an edit)

1536 28Dec2023
  Update on patientinfo.php:
    - added a delete button that has a confirm box pop-up (not functional YET)

1557 28Dec2023
  Update on patientinfo.php:
    - functional delete button with confirm pop-up
  Update on database.php:
    - renamed delete() function to deletefromtable() because the former is already an existing function

1926 30Dec2023
  IMPORTANT NOTES:
    $displayedCheckIn['CheckIn_ID'] in vitalsigns.php and $priorinfo['CheckIn_ID'] in EditVitalSigns.php pertains to a SPECIFIC person's
  Update on vitalsigns.php:
    - additional prerequisites on when the person confirms the deletion of data on a check-in
    - edit $displayedCheckIn to include check in date and time
    - display check in date and time
    - an attempt at, when deleting a check-in in between two existing, make the counting linear
  Update on EditVitalSigns.php:
    - updated $priorInfo to incl. check in date and time
    - put inputs for updating check in time and dates
    - included updating for check in times and dates

0230 01Jan2024
  Update on vitalsigns.php:
  - attempt at using session to remove repetition of deletefromtable() execution (I don't understand why it's essentially like the other written functions tho)

1023 08Jan2024
  Update on database.php:
  - I am giving up and modifying the deletefromtable() function by removing the try catch
